Section 2.5 asks how to **judge** one regular switchback design against another. The authors use a decision-theoretic lens: pick the randomization plan that minimizes expected loss, where loss is the squared gap between what we estimate and the true lag-$p$ effect.

## Loss and risk for a switchback design

With a fixed design $\eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}(\cdot)$, realized assignment path $w_{1:T}$, and potential outcomes $Y$, define the loss

$$
L(\eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}, w_{1:T}, Y) = \left( \hat{\tau}_p(\eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}, w_{1:T}, Y) - \tau_p(Y) \right)^2.
$$

The **risk** of that design averages loss over every possible assignment path:

$$
r(\eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}, Y) = \sum_{w_{1:T} \in \{0,1\}^T} \eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}(w_{1:T}) \left( \hat{\tau}_p(\eta_{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{Q}}, w_{1:T}, Y) - \tau_p(Y) \right)^2. \tag{5}
$$

Because the Horvitz–Thompson estimator is unbiased under Assumptions 1–2, the risk equals the estimator’s variance. Lower risk $\iff$ lower variance, holding the true effect fixed.

## Example 6: same path, different variance

Two regular designs for $T=4$, $p=m=1$—one with randomization points $\mathcal{T} = \{1,3\}$, another with $\tilde{\mathcal{T}} = \{1,2,3,4\}$—can **produce the same realized path** $(1,1,0,0)$ but different estimators and losses. The difference comes entirely from the design-implied probabilities in the Horvitz–Thompson weights. Even identical data and paths yield different variance profiles when the underlying coin-flip schedule changes.

### Design A: two flips at $t = 1, 3$

- Path probability: $(1,1,0,0)$ occurs with probability $1/4$.
- Window probabilities: $\Pr(W_{1:2} = (1,1)) = 1/2$, $\Pr(W_{3:4} = (0,0)) = 1/2$.
- Estimator on this path:
  $$
  \hat{\tau}_1 = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{Y_2(1,1)}{1/2} - \frac{Y_4(0,0)}{1/2}\right) = \frac{2}{3}\left(Y_2(1,1) - Y_4(0,0)\right).
  $$
- Subtract the true lag-1 effect $\tau_1(Y) = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{t=2}^4 \big(Y_t(\mathbf{1}) - Y_t(\mathbf{0})\big)$ to get the loss:
  $$
  L_A = \frac{1}{9}\Big( Y_2(1,1) + Y_2(0,0) - Y_3(1,1) + Y_3(0,0) - Y_4(1,1) - Y_4(0,0) \Big)^2.
  $$
- Contribution of this path to risk: $\eta_A(w_{1:4}) \cdot L_A = \frac{1}{4} L_A$; other paths contribute analogous terms with their own weights.

### Design B: four flips at $t = 1,2,3,4$

- Path probability: $(1,1,0,0)$ occurs with probability $1/16$ (four fair coins).
- Window probabilities: $\Pr(W_{1:2} = (1,1)) = 1/4$, $\Pr(W_{3:4} = (0,0)) = 1/4$.
- Estimator on this path:
  $$
  \hat{\tau}_1 = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{Y_2(1,1)}{1/4} - \frac{Y_4(0,0)}{1/4}\right) = \frac{4}{3}\left(Y_2(1,1) - Y_4(0,0)\right).
  $$
- Loss after subtracting $\tau_1(Y)$:
  $$
  L_B = \frac{1}{9}\Big( 3Y_2(1,1) + Y_2(0,0) - Y_3(1,1) + Y_3(0,0) - Y_4(1,1) - 3Y_4(0,0) \Big)^2.
  $$
- Contribution of this path to risk: $\eta_B(w_{1:4}) \cdot L_B = \frac{1}{16} L_B$, again summed with the 15 other paths.

### Why the risks differ

Both designs are unbiased, but Design B inflates the weights (denominators are smaller), so any imbalance between $Y_2$ and $Y_4$ swings the estimate more. The risk $r(\eta, Y)$ for each design is the sum of these path-specific contributions; the change in probabilities cascades into a different overall variance, even though the realized data and path are identical.

## Takeaways for SBE planning

- Evaluate a candidate design by its risk (variance), not just by which paths are possible; coin placement and bias shape the estimator’s precision.
- Unbiasedness is guaranteed by regular designs, but precision is not—choosing $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ well is what shrinks risk.
- The upcoming optimality results (Section 3) search for the design $\eta_{\mathcal{T}^\*, \mathcal{Q}^\*}$ that minimizes risk in the worst case, making “better design” a concrete, quantitative target.
