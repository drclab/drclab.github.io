## Why this section matters
Section 1.5 reframes a long-standing debate in statistics for marketing analytics: should we prioritize **interpretable models** or **predictive performance**? The answer, in practice, is neither extreme. For causal marketing decisions, we need both.

## The two cultures, adapted to marketing
Leo Breiman described two statistical cultures:

1. **Data modelling**: explicit probabilistic structure, parametric assumptions, interpretable parameters.
2. **Algorithmic modelling**: flexible, data-adaptive prediction with minimal structural assumptions.

In marketing analytics, this maps to a familiar tension:
- **Prediction-first systems** (churn models, recommendation engines, bid optimization) are effective at forecasting within the current environment.
- **Decision-first questions** (launch, pricing, media mix, market entry) require **causal inference**—not just prediction.

The key insight from Section 1.5 is that the real tension is not “prediction vs interpretation,” but **rigid assumptions vs flexible methods**, and **prediction vs causality**. Neither culture alone guarantees causal validity.

## Why prediction is insufficient
Prediction answers: *“What happens under the current system?”*

Causal inference answers: *“What would happen if we intervene?”*

Marketing strategy lives in the second space. A model that predicts sales from ad spend does not, by itself, tell us whether changing spend **causes** sales to move. To get causal answers, we need:

- Explicit **estimands** (ATE, ATT, cohort-time effects)
- Explicit **identification assumptions** (parallel trends, unconfoundedness, factor structure, SUTVA)
- Diagnostics and sensitivity analysis to validate those assumptions

## A synthesis: modern panel causal methods
Section 1.5 argues that **modern panel methods** provide a practical synthesis:

- **Algorithmic flexibility** handles high-dimensional confounders and heterogeneity.
- **Design-based identification** makes causal structure explicit and testable.

A representative example is **double machine learning**: ML models estimate nuisance functions, while causal identification ensures the final effect estimate is valid.

This approach prioritizes **causal validity**, using machine learning as a tool—rather than treating prediction as the objective.

## A pragmatic workflow (four steps)
The section proposes a pragmatic, application-first workflow:

1. **Specify the estimand and assumptions**
   - Define the target quantity (ATE, ATT, elasticity, $\tau(g, t)$)
   - State the assumptions needed for a causal interpretation

2. **Choose an estimator that matches the design**
   - DiD, synthetic control, interactive fixed effects, doubly robust ML
   - Estimator must align with the identification strategy

3. **Run diagnostics**
   - Pre-trends, placebos, balance checks, robustness, specification curves

4. **Conduct sensitivity analysis**
   - Quantify how strong violations must be to overturn conclusions

This workflow integrates the strengths of both cultures: flexible modelling **inside** a disciplined causal design.

## Practical takeaway
Marketing analytics needs more than accurate forecasts—it needs credible counterfactuals. The two-cultures framing is useful, but the real goal is **causal decision support**. Modern panel methods help bridge that gap by blending:

- **Flexible machine learning** for high-dimensional data
- **Explicit causal assumptions** for interpretability and validity

This is the foundation for the methods that follow in the MMM series.
