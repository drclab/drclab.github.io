## The core idea
Panel data methods exploit a simple asymmetry: when we observe the same units repeatedly, we can compare **changes** in treated units to **changes** in untreated units. This within-unit, over-time variation helps separate causal effects from background trends.

## Why cross-sections and time series fall short
- **Cross-sections** compare different units at one time. Differences may reflect pre-existing gaps (e.g., store quality) rather than marketing impact.
- **Time series** track one unit over time. Changes may be driven by seasonality or macro shocks, not the intervention.

Panel data combines both dimensions: multiple units, many periods. That enables a difference-in-differences logic that can remove time-invariant confounders and common shocks when assumptions like parallel trends are plausible.

## What counts as panel data
Panel data means **the same units measured repeatedly**. That is different from repeated cross-sections (different samples each period). Panels allow us to control for unobserved unit traits; repeated cross-sections usually cannot.

## Where panel methods sit in causal reasoning
Panel methods are aimed at **intervention-level** questions: what happens if we change the marketing action? They can move us beyond pure association, but only with explicit assumptions about assignment and outcome dynamics. Stronger assumptions are required to answer counterfactual “what would have happened” questions.

## A quick map of panel families (conceptual)
- **Standard panels:** many units over many periods; classic difference-in-differences and fixed effects.
- **Multi-way panels:** store × product × region data arranged as matrices/tensors; uses low-rank structure.
- **Spatial/interference panels:** recognizes spillovers via geography or networks.
- **High-dimensional/ML panels:** leverages rich covariates with orthogonalized estimation.

## Takeaway
Panel data methods are not “just regressions.” They are a design-based toolkit for credible causal measurement when experiments are infeasible. The power comes from repeated observation of the same units and from making identifying assumptions explicit and testable where possible.
