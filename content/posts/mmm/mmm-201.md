## Why this section matters
Chapter 1 highlights endogeneity, dynamics, and spillovers. Section 2.1 provides the formal language to state causal questions clearly and to see which assumptions an estimator needs.

## The panel setup
We observe $N$ units over $T$ periods. Outcomes are $Y_{it}$ and treatments are $D_{it}$. For now, think of $D_{it}$ as binary (treated vs not). The central causal object is a *potential outcome* that says what would happen under a specified treatment.

## Two notations for potential outcomes
1. **Contemporaneous notation:** $Y_{it}(d)$ depends only on current treatment in period $t$. This is convenient but assumes no anticipation and no carryover.
2. **Path-dependent notation:** $Y_{it}(\mathbf{d}_{it})$ depends on the whole treatment history $\mathbf{d}_{it}=(d_{i1},\ldots,d_{it})$. This is the right object when dynamics, habit formation, or strategic responses matter.

Marketing settings often require the path-dependent form because campaigns build stock, loyalty effects accumulate, and competitors react over time.

## Key assumptions and what they buy you
- **Assumption 1 (No anticipation):** future treatments do not affect current outcomes. Violations show up as pre-trends in event studies.
- **Assumption 2 (No carryover):** past treatments do not affect current outcomes. Violations imply that $Y_{it}(d)$ is too simple.
- **Assumption 3 (SUTVA for panels):** outcomes depend only on a unit's own treatment history and treatment versions are consistent. In marketing, interference and version differences are common, so this assumption must be defended or relaxed.

When Assumptions 1 and 2 hold, you can work with $Y_{it}(d)$ and static DiD-style estimands. When they fail, you need dynamic specifications, distributed lags, or explicit spillover models.

## Why assignment matters
Even with correct potential outcomes, identification depends on the *assignment mechanism* $\Pr(D \mid Y(\cdot), X)$. Marketing treatments are strategic and often depend on past outcomes. That is why design-based arguments (experiments, staggered rollouts, synthetic control, instruments) are essential.

## Takeaway
Potential outcomes provide the language for causal questions in panels. The simple notation is useful, but marketing almost always demands the richer path-dependent framework and explicit attention to anticipation, carryover, and interference.
