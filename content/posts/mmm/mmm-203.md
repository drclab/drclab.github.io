## Start with the question
“Does the loyalty program work?” is not an estimand. You must define **for whom**, **when**, and **how** you want to aggregate effects. Section 2.3 lays out the core estimands that make those choices explicit.

## ATE vs ATT
Using contemporaneous notation $Y_{it}(d)$:

- **ATE:** $\mathrm{ATE}=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)]$ answers the average effect if all units were treated in all periods.
- **ATT:** $\mathrm{ATT}=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)\mid D_{it}=1]$ focuses on the treated units and periods, which is often the ROI-relevant quantity in marketing.

ATE is useful for fully randomized settings; ATT is often the practical target when adoption is selective.

## Cohort–time effects for staggered adoption
When adoption is staggered, effects can vary by cohort and calendar time. Define the cohort–time effect:

$$
\tau(g,t)=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(g)-Y_{it}(\infty)\mid G_i=g], \quad t\ge g.
$$

Aggregating $\tau(g,t)$ with different weights answers different policy questions. Traditional two-way fixed effects often mix these cells with unintuitive or even negative weights when effects are heterogeneous.

## Event-time effects and dynamics
Event time is $k=t-G_i$. The dynamic response is captured by:

$$
\theta_k=\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,G_i+k}(G_i)-Y_{i,G_i+k}(\infty)\mid G_i<\infty].
$$

For $k<0$, $\theta_k$ acts as a pre-trend check. For $k\ge 0$, it traces habit formation, wear-out, and delayed effects.

## Long-run multiplier
Dynamic effects often matter more than the immediate lift. The **long-run multiplier** compares cumulative impact to the initial effect:

$$
\mathrm{LRM}=\frac{\sum_{k=0}^K \theta_k}{\theta_0}.
$$

If $\mathrm{LRM}>1$, carryover amplifies the total impact beyond the immediate lift.

## Table 2.1 at a glance
| Estimand | Definition | Interpretation | When most relevant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ATE | $\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)]$ | Average effect if all units treated | Randomized experiments; strong overlap |
| ATT | $\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)\mid D_{it}=1]$ | Average effect on treated units | Policy evaluation; ROI |
| $\tau(g,t)$ | $\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(g)-Y_{it}(\infty)\mid G_i=g]$ | Cohort–time effect | Staggered rollouts; heterogeneity |
| $\theta_k$ | $\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,G_i+k}(G_i)-Y_{i,G_i+k}(\infty)\mid G_i<\infty]$ | Effect $k$ periods post-adoption | Dynamic effects; pre-trends |
| LRM | $\sum_{k=0}^K \theta_k/\theta_0$ | Cumulative vs immediate effect | Carryover; habit formation |

## Takeaway
Estimands are not technical details—they are the causal question. Precise definitions are what connect marketing decisions to the right identification strategy and estimator.
