## Why continuous treatments matter
Many marketing levers are continuous: ad spend, discount depth, loyalty rewards, and prices. Treating them as binary loses information and can distort the causal target. Continuous treatment designs keep the intensity scale and focus on dose-response functions.

## The estimand: dose-response
Let $D_{it}\in \mathbb{R}$ denote treatment intensity. Potential outcomes are $Y_{it}(d)$, and the conditional dose-response is:

$$
\mu(d\mid x)=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(d)\mid X_{it}=x].
$$

The average dose-response is $\mu(d)=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(d)]$, obtained by averaging over the covariate distribution. Marginal effects and elasticities are derived from the slope of $\mu(d)$.

## Two core assumptions
**1) Conditional independence (unconfoundedness).**

$$
Y_{it}(d) \perp D_{it} \mid X_{it}, \alpha_i, \lambda_t, \quad \forall d \in D.
$$

After conditioning on covariates and fixed effects, treatment intensity is as-good-as-random.

**2) Positivity (overlap).**

$$
0 < r(d\mid X_{it}, \alpha_i, \lambda_t) \quad \text{for all } d \text{ in the support of interest.}
$$

If no units ever have low (or high) intensity, causal effects at those levels are not identified.

## Why panels help
Unit fixed effects control for time-invariant confounders, and time fixed effects control for common shocks. This makes unconfoundedness more plausible, but only if the remaining confounders are time-varying and observed.

## Practical identification strategies
- **High-dimensional controls and DML:** flexibly adjust for many confounders without overfitting.
- **Factor models:** capture common demand shocks and identify effects from unit-specific deviations.
- **Generalized propensity scores:** check overlap across intensity levels.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating intensity as binary when the dose-response is nonlinear.
- Ignoring overlap violations (e.g., zero-spend cells never occur).
- Confounding from feedback loops where spend responds to recent outcomes.

## Takeaway
Continuous treatment designs target dose-response functions, but they require stronger assumptions than binary designs. Credible inference depends on overlap, rich controls, and diagnostics that probe sensitivity to treatment intensity modeling.
