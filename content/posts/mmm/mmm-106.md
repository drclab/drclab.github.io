## Why Section 1.6 matters
Section 1.6 explains *where* panel causal methods earn their keep: strategic, dynamic marketing settings where descriptive models are useful but insufficient for causal decisions. The section highlights six domains and shows how panel designs add identification structure to familiar marketing models.

## 1) Market entry and competitive timing
**Question:** When should a firm enter a market, and what is the first-mover advantage?

Panel data on staggered entry across markets enables **difference-in-differences** designs that compare early vs late entrants while controlling for time-invariant market traits and common shocks. The key requirement is parallel trends for untreated outcomes. Entry effects are naturally heterogeneous across cohorts, so estimands like $\tau(g,t)$ and event-time effects $\theta_k$ are more informative than a single average.

## 2) Innovation diffusion and takeoff
**Question:** How do marketing actions accelerate adoption?

Bass diffusion curves are descriptive; they don’t identify causal effects of interventions. Panel data lets you embed diffusion into quasi-experimental designs: staggered rollouts, instruments, or panel DiD on takeoff timing. The idea is to move from “how adoption looks” to “what shifted it.”

## 3) Advertising effectiveness and carryover
**Question:** How do ad effects accumulate and decay?

Distributed-lag and Koyck-style models describe carryover, but panel designs provide the **identification structure** needed for causal interpretation. With market-by-week variation, you can estimate elasticities, decay rates, and saturation while using design-based tools (DiD, synthetic control) to address endogeneity.

## 4) Marketing investments and shareholder value
**Question:** Do campaigns and launches create shareholder value?

Finance-style event studies estimate abnormal returns around announcements, under assumptions like no confounding news and fast price adjustment. Panelizing many events adds power and supports heterogeneity, but doesn’t fully solve endogenous timing—so careful design remains essential.

## 5) User-generated content and online reviews
**Question:** Do reviews cause sales—or do sales cause reviews?

Review activity is often endogenous: popular products attract more reviews. Panel data combined with VARs can show *temporal precedence* (Granger causality), but causal claims require stronger identification—quasi-experimental variation or explicit structural assumptions.

## 6) Competitive dynamics and spillovers
**Question:** How do rivals respond to your actions?

Panel data on competitor actions supports **reaction functions** and causal spillover analysis. DiD and synthetic control quantify how one firm’s decisions affect rivals’ outcomes, capturing equilibrium effects that static models miss.

## The core lesson
Classical marketing models (Bass diffusion, Koyck lags, VARs) describe dynamics. Panel causal methods add the **design and identification machinery** that turns those descriptions into credible causal estimates. In short: description → design → decision.
