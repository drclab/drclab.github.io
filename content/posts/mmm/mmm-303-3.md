## Why buffer zones exist
Geographic spillovers violate SUTVA: treatment in one market can affect outcomes in nearby markets through travel, media overlap, or local competition. Buffer zones create geographic separation by excluding untreated regions adjacent to treated markets.

## How wide should a buffer be?
The buffer width depends on how fast spillovers decay with distance:
- **Short-range spillovers:** narrow buffers are sufficient.
- **Long-range spillovers:** buffers must be wide, which reduces effective sample size and power.

This is a design trade-off between contamination risk and statistical precision.

## Buffer zones are not a universal fix
Buffer zones only address **spatial** spillovers. They do not solve:
- Network spillovers (social sharing, word-of-mouth).
- Competitive spillovers (national pricing responses).

When these are plausible, explicit spillover models with exposure mappings $h_g(D_{-g,t})$ are required.

## When spillovers are part of the estimand
If spillovers are substantively important, you should measure outcomes in buffer zones rather than exclude them. A common design is three groups:
- Treated markets
- Neighboring buffer markets
- Distant controls

This enables estimation of direct and spillover effects, provided the neighborhood structure is correctly specified.

## Sensitivity to neighborhood definitions
The three-group design depends on how you define "neighboring" and "distant" markets. Misspecification biases both direct and spillover estimates. Sensitivity checks across alternative neighborhood definitions are essential.

## Takeaway
Buffer zones are a useful design tool, but they only handle spatial spillovers. When spillovers are central or non-spatial, the estimand must incorporate exposure and the design must measure spillover paths directly.
