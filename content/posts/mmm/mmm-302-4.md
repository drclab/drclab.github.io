## What is a common shock design?
A common shock design has a single event at time $t_0$ that affects all units simultaneously: a regulatory change, platform update, pandemic, or a national campaign. Treatment is

$$
D_{it}=\mathbf{1}\{t\ge t_0\},
$$

so there is no cross-sectional variation in treatment timing.

## Event studies are the workhorse
With no variation in timing, identification relies on time-series variation. The standard tool is an event study that estimates separate coefficients for each lead and lag around $t_0$.

- **Leads** diagnose anticipation and help assess pre-shock stability.
- **Lags** trace the dynamic response and accumulation over time.

## The core identification risk
In pure common-shock settings, event studies are **primarily descriptive** unless you can defend an exclusion-style argument: nothing else changes at $t_0$ that could drive the observed break.

Without cross-sectional variation, the entire identification hinges on the claim that the shock is exogenous and unique. This is a strong assumption in marketing settings where multiple changes often co-occur (platform tweaks, pricing adjustments, macro conditions).

## How to strengthen identification
When additional variation exists, you can move from descriptive to causal:
- **Exposure gradients:** if units vary in exposure intensity, use a continuous-treatment DiD to exploit heterogeneity.
- **Comparison groups:** if some units are plausibly less exposed, use them as a control.
- **Timing checks:** confirm no other policy or operational changes align with $t_0$.

## Diagnostics that matter
- Pre-shock trend stability.
- Sensitivity to alternative windows around $t_0$.
- Robustness to adding controls for concurrent changes.

## Takeaway
Common shock designs can be informative, but they are fragile. Event studies are the right first step, yet credible causal interpretation requires either strong exclusion arguments or additional cross-sectional variation in exposure.
