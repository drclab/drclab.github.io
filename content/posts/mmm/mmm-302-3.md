## What is a single treated unit design?
A single treated unit design has exactly one treated unit and many controls. Examples include a flagship store redesign, a pilot market launch, or a platform entry into a single city. The treated unit is typically unique, so direct matching to a single control unit is implausible.

## The estimand is unit-specific
The target is a unit-specific effect for the treated unit $i^*$ in each post-treatment period:

$$
Y_{i^*t}(1)-Y_{i^*t}(0).
$$

This is not a population ATT. The estimate has high internal validity for the treated unit, but limited external validity for generalizing beyond it.

## Synthetic control: the core tool
Synthetic control builds a weighted combination of control units to match the treated unit’s pre-treatment outcomes. The post-treatment difference between the treated unit and its synthetic counterpart is the causal estimate.

Why this works: if the synthetic control tracks the treated unit closely before treatment, a stable low-rank factor structure implies it should continue to track in the absence of treatment.

## Inference via placebo checks
Inference is not based on standard asymptotics. Instead, we use placebo tests:
- Apply the same synthetic control procedure to each control unit as if it were treated.
- Compare the treated unit’s estimated effect to the distribution of placebo effects.

This provides a reference distribution for how large an effect could appear by chance under the design.

## Synthetic DiD as a hybrid
Synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID) combines the strengths of synthetic control and DiD. It weights both units and time periods, improving pre-treatment fit while still leveraging DiD logic. SDID is especially useful when there are multiple pre- and post-treatment periods and moderate parallel-trends credibility.

## Diagnostics that matter most
- **Pre-treatment fit:** the treated unit should be well-approximated by the synthetic control.
- **Placebo distributions:** the treated effect should stand out relative to controls.
- **Sensitivity to donor pool:** check robustness to removing or adding controls.

## Takeaway
Single treated unit designs are powerful but narrow. They provide credible, unit-specific causal estimates when synthetic control achieves strong pre-treatment fit, and when placebo tests confirm the effect is unusual relative to controls.
