## Why this reference exists
Section 2.8 collects the notation and assumptions that recur across the rest of the book. In practice, it is a quick lookup: when a method or diagnostic is introduced later, you can map it back to a small set of symbols and assumptions.

## Core notation, in plain language
- Units are indexed by $i=1,\ldots,N$ and time by $t=1,\ldots,T$.
- Observed outcomes are $Y_{it}$.
- Potential outcomes can be **contemporaneous** $Y_{it}(d)$ or **path dependent** $Y_{it}(d_{ti})$.
- Treatment is $D_{it}$, usually binary but sometimes continuous.
- Under staggered adoption, $G_i$ is the first treated period (or $\infty$ for never treated), and event time is $k=t-G_i$.

Key estimands:

$$
\mathrm{ATE}=\mathbb{E}_{i,t}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)],\quad
\mathrm{ATT}=\mathbb{E}_{i,t}[Y_{it}(1)-Y_{it}(0)\mid D_{it}=1].
$$

Staggered adoption adds:

$$
\tau(g,t)=\mathbb{E}[Y_{it}(g)-Y_{it}(\infty)\mid G_i=g],\quad t\ge g,
$$

$$
\theta_k=\mathbb{E}[Y_{i,G_i+k}(G_i)-Y_{i,G_i+k}(\infty)\mid G_i<\infty].
$$

## Core assumptions (short form)
These are the building blocks that drive which estimators are valid.

- **No anticipation (Assumption 1):** outcomes at $t$ do not depend on treatments assigned in future periods.
- **SUTVA (Assumption 3):** no interference and a single version of treatment.
- **No dynamic effects (Assumption 4):** outcomes depend only on current treatment, not past treatments.
- **Parallel trends (Assumption 6):** untreated outcome changes are the same across cohorts before treatment.
- **Unconfoundedness (Assumption 7):** after conditioning on covariates and fixed effects, treatment is independent of potential outcomes.
- **Homogeneous effects (Assumption 8):** treatment effects are constant across units and time.

## Factor structure: a key relaxation
When parallel trends is too strong, a low-rank factor structure provides an alternative:

$$
Y_{it}(\infty)=\alpha_i+\lambda_t+\sum_{r=1}^R \lambda_{ir} f_{tr}+\varepsilon_{it},
$$

with $R \ll \min(N,T)$. Identification then depends on residual treatment variation being as-good-as-random after conditioning on the latent factors and observed covariates.

## Why the assumptions matter
Different methods rely on different subsets:
- **DiD and event studies** hinge on parallel trends and no anticipation.
- **Synthetic control** leans on pre-treatment fit under a factor structure.
- **DML and high-dimensional controls** rely on unconfoundedness.
- **TWFE** additionally needs homogeneous effects to yield a single interpretable parameter.
- **Spillover models** explicitly relax SUTVA.

## Takeaway
This reference section is the dictionary for the rest of MMM: estimands define the question, assumptions define credibility, and notation keeps the mapping precise. When you are unsure whether a method applies, check which assumptions it needs and whether your data can defend them.
