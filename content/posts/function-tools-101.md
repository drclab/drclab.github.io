Python's `functools` module is the Swiss army knife for turning functions into reusable building blocks. It ships with the standard library, introduces zero dependencies, and gives you battle-tested primitives for reshaping call signatures, caching results, and wiring polymorphic APIs. This guide surveys the tools you will reach for most, when to choose them, and the trade-offs to keep in mind in production code.

## 1. Bind arguments with `partial`

Importing the helper is as simple as:

```python
from functools import partial
```

`partial` pre-binds positional and keyword arguments to *any* callable, returning another callable with a slimmer interface. That is perfect for trimming callback signatures, constructing command factories, or pinning configuration.

```python
def send_email(recipient, subject, body, *, footer="--"):
    return f"To: {recipient}\nSubject: {subject}\n\n{body}\n{footer}"

invoice_email = partial(send_email, subject="Invoice", footer="— paid via ACH")

print(invoice_email("team@example.com", body="Thanks for your business!"))
```

```text
To: team@example.com
Subject: Invoice

Thanks for your business!
— paid via ACH
```

Partial objects stay introspectable thanks to `.func`, `.args`, and `.keywords`. Log them in tests when you suspect a binding mismatch. When you stack partials, later keyword bindings override earlier ones, which makes targeted overrides trivial in fixtures.

## 2. Pre-configure methods with `partialmethod`

Need the same trick for instance methods? Reach for `functools.partialmethod`. It works like `partial`, but lets method descriptors keep their binding semantics.

```python
from functools import partialmethod

class JobRunner:
    def run(self, job_type, *, dry_run=False):
        print(f"running {job_type=} dry_run={dry_run}")

    run_dry = partialmethod(run, dry_run=True)
    run_live = partialmethod(run, dry_run=False)

runner = JobRunner()
runner.run_dry("sync-users")
```

Both shortcuts still pass `self` under the hood, so you get clean entry points for CLI commands, Celery tasks, or scheduled jobs without extra wrappers.

## 3. Write friendly decorators with `wraps`

Decorators can hide metadata from tooling unless you pass it through. `functools.wraps` (a thin wrapper around `update_wrapper`) copies important attributes like `__name__`, `__doc__`, and `__module__`.

```python
from functools import wraps

def audit(tag):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"[{tag}] calling {func.__name__}")
            return func(*args, **kwargs)

        return wrapper

    return decorator

@audit("billing")
def charge(amount):
    """Process a payment."""
    return f"charged {amount}"
```

Without `@wraps`, the decorator would report its own name (`wrapper`) and documentation, confusing debuggers, type checkers, and API docs.

## 4. Cache results with `lru_cache` and `cache`

When a function is pure—or at least idempotent given its arguments—memoization avoids recomputation. `lru_cache` stores the most recent results, while `cache` (3.9+) caches without eviction.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=256)
def geocode(address):
    print("hitting external API")
    return {"lat": 42.0, "lon": -71.0}

geocode("1 Main Street")   # hits the API
geocode("1 Main Street")   # served from cache
```

Use `geocode.cache_info()` to inspect hit ratios, and call `geocode.cache_clear()` in tests to reset global state. Be mindful of mutable arguments—they must be hashable or you will get a `TypeError`.

## 5. Dispatch by type with `singledispatch`

`singledispatch` picks an implementation based on the first argument's type. It is a clean alternative to long `if isinstance(...)` ladders, especially in serialization or rendering code.

```python
from functools import singledispatch

@singledispatch
def to_json(value):
    raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type: {type(value)!r}")

@to_json.register
def _(value: int):
    return value

@to_json.register
def _(value: list):
    return [to_json(item) for item in value]

@to_json.register
def _(value: dict):
    return {key: to_json(val) for key, val in value.items()}

to_json([1, {"a": 2}])
```

Combine it with type hints for clarity; static analyzers understand the overload table. Python 3.8+ also offers `singledispatchmethod` when you need this behavior on instance methods.

## 6. Compute-once attributes with `cached_property`

When an attribute is expensive to derive but deterministic per instance, `cached_property` computes it lazily once and stores the result.

```python
from functools import cached_property

class Report:
    def __init__(self, rows):
        self._rows = rows

    @cached_property
    def totals(self):
        print("aggregating rows…")
        return sum(row["amount"] for row in self._rows)

report = Report([{"amount": 10}, {"amount": 20}])
report.totals  # prints "aggregating rows…"
report.totals  # uses cached value
```

Invalidate by deleting the attribute (`del report.totals`) if you mutate the underlying data.

## 7. Compose reducers with `reduce`

`reduce` folds an iterable into a single value using an accumulator function. Reach for it when you already have a reusable reducer; otherwise, a loop or `sum` is often clearer.

```python
from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

def factorial(n):
    return reduce(mul, range(1, n + 1), 1)

factorial(5)  # 120
```

Starting values (the third argument) guard against empty iterables and keep types stable. Think twice before stacking complex lambdas inside `reduce`; clarity wins.

## 8. Testing, debugging, and project hygiene

- Inspect captured state: partial objects expose `.func`, `.args`, and `.keywords`; caches report hit ratios via `.cache_info()`.
- Reset global state in unit tests by clearing caches (`cache_clear`) and tearing down `cached_property` attributes (`del instance.attr`).
- Prefer module-level helpers over ad-hoc lambdas—tools like coverage, profilers, and debuggers see the real call site when you use `functools`.
- Document decorator behavior, especially when they change return types or introduce side effects; pairing `@wraps` with docstring examples keeps API docs accurate.

`functools` rewards disciplined use. The more you lean on these helpers, the less bespoke glue code you have to maintain, and the easier it becomes to reason about how your callables behave under tests, in async workers, and across different runtime environments.
