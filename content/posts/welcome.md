Welcome to the refreshed DRC Lab site. Dr. C.J. Duan welcomes you â€” a restless codexer who explores Bayesian data, tooling, and reproducible research while continuously iterating on how we present ideas.

We are experimenting with the Gokarna theme to deliver a clean reading experience. Expect frequent updates as we migrate research summaries, process notes, and tooling guides into this space.
