Welcome to Rust 105-2! Let's dive into practical examples of using structs in Rust. We'll start with a simple rectangle area calculation and progressively improve it, demonstrating how structs make code clearer and more maintainable.

## Basic Area Calculation

Let's start with calculating rectangle area using separate variables:

```rust
fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
```

Run this code:
```bash
$ cargo run
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

This works, but the relationship between width and height isn't clear in the function signature.

## Refactoring with Tuples

We can group width and height using a tuple:

```rust
fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
```

Run this:
```bash
$ cargo run
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

Better! Now we pass one argument. But we still need to remember that `0` is width and `1` is height.

## Refactoring with Structs

Structs give meaningful names to our data:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

Run this:
```bash
$ cargo run
The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
```

Perfect! Now the code clearly shows we're calculating a rectangle's area using its width and height fields. We borrow the struct to avoid moving it.

## Adding Debug Output

To see our struct's contents during development, add the Debug trait:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
    println!("rect1 is {:#?}", rect1); // Pretty print
}
```

Run this:
```bash
$ cargo run
rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
```

The `{:?}` format shows debug output, while `{:#?}` formats it nicely with indentation.

## Using the dbg! Macro

For debugging expressions, use the `dbg!` macro:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),  // Debug the expression
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&rect1);  // Debug the struct (borrow to avoid moving)
}
```

Run this:
```bash
$ cargo run
[src/main.rs:8:16] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:12:5] &rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
```

`dbg!` prints the file, line number, and value, then returns the value. It outputs to stderr, unlike `println!` which goes to stdout.

## Complete Example with Methods

Let's combine everything into a complete program:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    let rect2 = Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 40,
    };

    let rect3 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 45,
    };

    println!("rect1 area: {}", rect1.area());
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));

    // Debug output
    println!("rect1: {:#?}", rect1);
}
```

Run this:
```bash
$ cargo run
rect1 area: 1500
Can rect1 hold rect2? true
Can rect1 hold rect3? false
rect1: Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
```

This example shows:
- Struct definition with `#[derive(Debug)]`
- Method implementation with `impl`
- Borrowing with `&self` and `&Rectangle`
- Debug formatting

## Comparison: Before and After

**Before (separate variables):**
```rust
fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
```

**After (with structs):**
```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

The struct version is self-documenting and prevents mixing up width and height.

Structs transform unclear code into meaningful, maintainable programs. They group related data and provide a foundation for methods. Practice these patterns in your Rust projects!

In the next post, we'll explore method syntax in more depth.
