Welcome to Rust 107-2! Modules organize code, but to use items, you need paths. This post covers paths for referring to items in the module tree, with diagrams illustrating concepts.

## Absolute and Relative Paths

Paths navigate the module tree like filesystem paths. There are two types:

- **Absolute paths**: Start from crate root with `crate`.
- **Relative paths**: Start from current module.

Consider this module tree:

```
crate
 └── front_of_house
     └── hosting
         └── add_to_waitlist
```

To call `add_to_waitlist` from `eat_at_restaurant` in crate root:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

**Diagram of paths:**

```
Absolute: crate -> front_of_house -> hosting -> add_to_waitlist
Relative: front_of_house -> hosting -> add_to_waitlist
```

This code doesn't compile yet due to privacy—modules are private by default.

## Exposing Paths with the pub Keyword

Use `pub` to make items accessible. Make modules and functions public:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {
            println!("Added to waitlist!");
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

**Privacy rule**: Child modules can access parents, but not vice versa unless public.

Diagram showing visibility:

```
crate (public)
 └── front_of_house (private, but accessible from crate)
     └── hosting (pub)
         └── add_to_waitlist (pub)
```

## Starting Relative Paths with super

Use `super` to reference parent modules, like `..` in filesystems.

```rust
fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order(); // Calls parent function
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
```

**Diagram:**

```
back_of_house
 ├── fix_incorrect_order
 └── cook_order

super::deliver_order -> (up to crate) -> deliver_order
```

## Making Structs and Enums Public

For structs, `pub` makes the struct public, but fields are private unless marked:

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String, // Private
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat"); // OK, pub field
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries"); // Error, private
    println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);
}
```

For enums, `pub` makes the enum and all variants public:

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
```

**Diagram for struct:**

```
Breakfast (pub)
 ├── toast (pub)
 └── seasonal_fruit (private)
```

## Summary

Paths let you reference module items. Absolute start with `crate`, relative from current. `pub` controls visibility, `super` accesses parents. Struct fields need individual `pub`, enums variants are public with `pub enum`.

Next, we'll explore bringing paths into scope with `use`.
