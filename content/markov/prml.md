This leading textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. This is the first machine learning textbook to include a comprehensive coverage of recent developments such as probabilistic graphical models and deterministic inference methods, and to emphasize a modern Bayesian perspective. It is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics.
