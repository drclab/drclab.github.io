    # Keep the container running if needed, or just let it exit after script
    # For development, it might be useful to keep it alive or just run the script.
    # Since the user asked to "start the container", running the script and exiting is fine for now.
    # But if they want to develop, maybe `tail -f /dev/null` is better?
    # The user's request "creates an image using Groq LLM service" implies using it.
    # The current main.py just runs and exits. I'll stick to that for now.
